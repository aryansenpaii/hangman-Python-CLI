# Hangman Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The game is played entirely in the command line interface.

## How to Play

1. Run the `hangman.py` file in your Python environment.
2. You will be prompted to guess a letter.
3. Guess letters one by one to reveal the hidden word.
4. You have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game is over.
5. Keep guessing until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
